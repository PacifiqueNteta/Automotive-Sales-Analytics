## 1. Project Overview and Objectives
### 1.1. Overview
This project analyzes U.S. automotive sales data from **January 2022 to December 2023**, aiming to uncover trends in revenue, customer behavior, dealership performance, and seasonal patterns.

### 1.2. üéØ Project Objectives
- Identify top-performing dealerships, brands, and regions for strategic expansion.
- Segment customers by income and gender to understand purchasing behavior.
- Evaluate monthly and yearly sales trends to support inventory and marketing planning.
- Compare domestic vs. foreign brand performance.
- Deliver actionable insights for dealerships, customers, and manufacturers

## 2. Tools used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Power BI** | Data modeling, DAX calculations, visualization |
| **Power Query** | Data cleaning, transformation, date table creation |
| **Excel** | Initial data inspection and validation |
| **DAX & M** | Calculated columns, measures, and dimension tables |

## 3. Data Source and Context

- **Source**: [Kaggle ‚Äì Car Sales Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report) by Vasu Avasthi
- **Dataset**: `car_data.csv` ‚Äì 23,906 car sales across the U.S.
- **Temporal Coverage**: January 1, 2022 ‚Äì December 30, 2023
- **Key Fields**: Price, Customer Name, Annual Income, Gender, Dealer Region, Brand, Model, Body Style, Transmission, Date

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This dataset may not represent the full U.S. market. It includes select dealerships and lacks full customer identifiers (e.g., unique customer ID), which impacts individual-level analysis.

---
## 4. Methodology

### 4.1. Data Preparation/Cleaning
- **Inspection**: Loaded data into Excel and Power BI to assess structure, completeness, and quality.
- **Cleaning**:
  - Renamed and standardized column names.
  - Fixed data types (e.g., Date ‚Üí Date/Time).
  - Removed trailing spaces in text fields (e.g., `"Audi "` ‚Üí `"Audi"`).
- **Date Dimension Table**:
  - Created using M code in Power Query for robust time intelligence:

  ```M Code(powerquery)
  = List.Dates(
     Source,
     Number.From(#date(2023, 12, 31))- Number.From(Source),
     #duration(1,0,0,0)
  )
  ```
With the source here being `2022/01/01` as it was the start temporal coverage start date of the data.

- Expanded into: Year, Month, Day of Week, Start of Month, etc.


### 4.2. Data Modeling 

- Built a **star schema** with:
  - **Fact Table**: `Car Sales` (transactions)
  - **Dimension Table**: `Date Table`
- Created a **one-to-many relationship** between `Date Table[Date]` and `Car Sales[Date]`.

### 4.3. Data Transformation

Here I created some calculated measures and calculated columns to help me in my analysis. To keep things clean, I decided to create a table for all measures which I named *Measure Table*. All the DAX calculated measures can be accessed [here](https://github.com/PacifiqueNteta/Automotive-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/DAX%20Measures) and the DAX calculated columns [here](https://github.com/PacifiqueNteta/Automotive-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/DAX%20Calculated%20Columns)

#### üîπ Calculated Columns
| Column | Logic |
|-------|------|
| `Car Country of origin` | Mapped brand to country (e.g., Toyota ‚Üí Japan) |
| `Income Level` | Segmented customers:<br>‚Äì Lower: < $35K<br>‚Äì Middle: $35K‚Äì$100K<br>‚Äì Upper-Middle: $100K‚Äì$200K<br>‚Äì High: > $200K |
| `Dealer_State` | Mapped region to state (e.g., Austin ‚Üí Texas) |

Calculated column Eg.:
```
Car Country of origin = 
SWITCH(
  'Car Sales'[Company],
  "Acura","Japan",
  "Audi","Germany",
  "BMW","Germany",
  "Buick","USA",
  "Cadillac","USA",
  "Chevrolet","USA",
  "Chrysler","USA",
  "Dodge","USA",
  "Ford","USA",
  "Honda","Japan",
  "Hyundai","South Korea",
  "Infiniti","Japan",
  "Jaguar","United Kingdom",
  "Jeep","USA",
  "Lexus","Japan",
  "Lincoln","USA",
  "Mercedes-B","Germany",
  "Mercury","USA",
  "Mitsubishi","Japan",
  "Nissan","Japan",
  "Oldsmobile","USA",
  "Plymouth","USA",
  "Pontiac","USA",
  "Porsche","Germany",
  "Saab","Sweden",
  "Saturn","USA",
  "Subaru","Japan",
  "Toyota","Japan",
  "Volkswagen","Germany",
  "Volvo","Sweden",
  "Unknown"
)
```

#### üîπ Key Measures (DAX)
All measures stored in a dedicated **Measure Table** for clarity.

```dax
Total Revenue = SUM('Car Sales'[Price])

Average Car Price = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM('Car Sales'[Price]),
    DISTINCTCOUNT('Car Sales'[Car_id])
)
```
```dax
Previous Month Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales(Cars Sold)],
    DATEADD('Date Table'[Date], -1, MONTH)
)
```
```dax
Average Revenue Per Customer = 
DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Customers])
```


### 4.4. Exploratory Data Analysis

#### 4.4.1. üõ†Ô∏è Critical Issue: Missing Unique Customer ID
- **Problem**: Only Customer Name (first name only) available ‚Üí duplicate names caused inflated customer-level metrics (e.g., one "Thomas" appeared to buy 90 cars).
- **Impact**: Risk of false aggregation and misleading insights.

<img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db612e60-5912-40b7-97b0-5a4acda6f351" />

- ‚úÖ Solution: Composite CustomerID
 Created a proxy identifier using:
  - First 3 + last 2 letters of name
  - Name length
  - Gender initial
  - Annual income
  - Example: Tho-ma-9-M-75000 for Thomas (9 letters, Male, $75K income) 

- **Result**: Reduced max purchases per "customer" from 90 ‚Üí 17, a more plausible figure.

<img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12582415-68c1-4d94-892b-e5f52dbf4173" />

>**‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation**: This is not a true unique ID. It assumes no two people share the same combination which may not hold.  


### 4.4.2. Some Data Exploratory Insights
After this I did some further exploratory analysis to try to answer the business questions and meet the objectives set at the beginning of the project.

Here are some insights found:

1. Total revenue by car brands:

2. Sales Quantity by Gender

3. Income Level group

Here based on the average salary in the USA, I created a customer segmentation on the annual salary.

I used the following DAX to create the segmentation:
```
Income Level = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
     'Car Sales'[Annual Income] < 35000, "Lower Income",
    'Car Sales'[Annual Income] <= 100000, "Middle Income",
    'Car Sales'[Annual Income] <= 200000, "Upper-Middle",
    "High Income"
)
```

## 7. Recommendations
### 7.1. üè¢ For Dealerships & New Entrants:
‚Ä¢ **Expand in High-Growth Regions**: Prioritize Austin and Janesville for new dealerships or marketing spend.
‚Ä¢ **Stock up Top Brands/Models**: Stock more Chevrolet, Ford, and Dodge vehicles, and promote high-revenue models like Lexus LS400.
‚Ä¢ **Target High-Income Male Buyers**: Tailor ads for SUVs/hatchbacks (e.g., luxury features for high-income males).
‚Ä¢ **Run Seasonal Promotions**: Boost inventory before peaks (May, September, December) and offer discounts in slower months (March).
### 7.2. üë§ For Customers:
‚Ä¢	Budget Buyers: Explore Buddy Storbeck‚Äôs Diesel Service Inc (avg. price $27,217; cheapest car at $900).
‚Ä¢	Luxury Seekers: Consider Lexus LS400 (high revenue per unit) or German brands (premium appeal).
### 4.3. üè≠ For Manufacturers:
‚Ä¢	USA Brands: Ramp up production of SUVs/hatchbacks (high demand).
‚Ä¢	Foreign Brands: Compete with US brands on other aspects such as innovation to gain more markets.

## 8. Limitations and Lessons Learned
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Limitations
- No True Customer ID: Composite `CustomerID` reduces but does not eliminate duplication risk.
- Data Representativeness: Dataset may not reflect national trends; limited to specific dealers.
- Short Time Span: Only 2 years of data; longer history would improve trend reliability.
- Self-Reported Income: Potential inaccuracies in income data.

### üí° Lessons Learned
- Always validate **data uniqueness** early in the pipeline.
- *Time intelligence* is critical, always build a proper date table.
- *Transparency* about data limitations builds credibility.
- Even **imperfect data** can yield **valuable insights** when **handled responsibly**.
